# Meet-Up Event Planner
A part of Udacity's Senior Web Developer Nanodegree Program




### About this Project

This is the first project from the Udacity's Senior Web Developer Nanodegree program.  The focus of this project is web forms -- specifically, simple web forms that are painless to fill out. The project should contain primarily three main parts:

* a form to create an account,
* a form to create an event, and
* an area that displays events.

[Additional requirements can be found in the project specification here.](requirements.pdf)



Additional features the app has, but were not required:

* events created by the user are saved to local storage, which means they will still be there when he closes his browser and opens it again.




### The easiest way to view the app

* Clone the repository to your desktop
* Open the index.html in the root of the repository with your favorite browser



### Running the Build Process

To use the same build process I used, clone the repository to your desktop, and from the root of the desktop, type the following command:

```
$ npm install 
```

After all of the modules from the package.json file have installed, run the following command: 

```
gulp watch
```
This will allow you to live edit the following files and immediately see the results on any device in your wireless network:

* index.html
* any file in the `ecma6` folder
* any file in the `sass` folder

Additionally, you can safely write with ECMA Script 6 and SASS, and your code will be converted into (almost) all-browser compatible ECMA Script 5 and CSS.
