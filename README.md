# Meet-Up Event Planner
A part of Udacity's Senior Web Develop Nanodegree Program




### About this Project

This is the first project from the Udacity's Senior Web Developer Nanodegree Program.  The focus of this project is web forms -- specifically, simple web forms that are painless to fill out. The project should contain three main parts:

* a form to create an account,
* a form to create an event, and
* an area that displays the events.

[Additional requirements can be found in the project specification here.](requirements.pdf)



Additional features the app has, but were not required:

* events created by the user are saved to local storage and will still be there when he closes browser and opens it again




### The easiest way to view the app

* Clone the repository to your desktop
* Open the index.html in the root of the repository with you favorite browser



### How to view the app on any device

This will run a local server on your computer, allowing you to view the app with any device in your wireless network.

In order to do that, you will need to do the following after cloning the repository to your desktop:


*Install the following dependecies from the root of the repository

```
$ npm install gulp
$ npm install gulp -g
$ npm install browser-sync -g

```

* Run the following gulp commmand from your command terminal

```

gulp watch

```
This will start a server on your local machine and provide you an URL you can use to view the open from any device
